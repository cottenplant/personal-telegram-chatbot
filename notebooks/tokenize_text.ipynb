This morning, while putting the final touches on the venue, the police arrived and forced us to vacate the premises.\\n\\nSo, now for Plan B.\\n\\nGo to the corner of Landsberger Allee and Langenbeckstra√üe (near the Landsberger Allee/Petersburger Str. tram stop - M5, M6, M8, M10) and wait on the staircase of the sports complex between one of two time slots, 0:00-1:00 AM or 2:00-3:00 AM.\\n\\nPlease wait here for the person wearing two red glow sticks around their wrist. Be patient, as they may not be there when you arrive as they are transporting people back and forth. This person will ensure you get inside the venue.\\n\\nIf you can‚Äôt find the meeting point or run into any issues, please do not hesitate to call us at our numbers, listed below. We would much rather you give us a call than wander around the neighborhood causing suspicion.\\n\\nAs we mentioned before, please remain as silent and discreet as possible when entering the venue ‚Äî take special care with any glass bottles or drinks you plan to bring inside.\\n\\nBecause we had to relocate at the last minute, we only have water and beer to offer at the bar. And remember, bring warm clothes!\\n\\nPlease spread the word to your fellow ravers about the change of location. We realize this is last minute and want to be sure everyone is in the loop.\\n\\nWe can‚Äôt wait to see you tonight! Rave on!\\nKoyaanisqatsi\\n\\nRemi\\n',\n",

I come into the peace of wild things\\nwho do not tax their lives with forethought\\nof grief.

Great feedback from that guy though and sounds like you'll have no problem getting a good job back here when you feel like it. You really seem to be moving forward quickly with the coding too!\\n\\nAny news from Phil re the backend?

It seems to be the wise option. Plus missing winter in berlin isn't exactly disappointing.\\n\\nMy next step with elibot is to code in the language dictionaries as a JSON list so I can call upon each variable instead of the coded strings in the elibot file (a messy hack :D ). I will send you a final list of the texts, or you can just query the bot. Honestly I will just run them through google translate first though, I think that will be enough for the time being.\\n\\nAbout the copyright, guess I was just thinking since I was talking about the project to the founder of the ai company in berlin, and he seemed really interested. He was really impressed and thought it a great idea, he said the next step is to really 'Go' with it. Hahha whatever that means (Googlespeak I assume). But I just thought, hm, everyone keeps saying this is a great idea.. I suppose we just need to get it out there on a blog and claim it. Let's look around for some Telegram related or refugee blogs or something.. see who would benefit from using it then we can inform people on some sort of grassroots level.\\n\\nHow's the weather in Berlin, any snow at all yet? I really do miss that cold crisp air, if only for the fact that it's literally like being in the middle of a pristine forest in the city; LA air is terrible, especially as it hasn't rained a drop all year.. we're in for some next week so hopefully that clears things up.
