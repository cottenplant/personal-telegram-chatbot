Hell yeah let's do it. Hahaha I think it's far enough tho but in November we can even go to tegel. Looks super neat. Gonna check it again at home on desktop. i wrote in the rhyme competition haha. Hahahahaha. Did you win?. there's a bunch of submissions and a whole process. yo what do you think of a good resources for me to learn nodejs. or should i learn javascript / typescript first or something?. definetely some JS first, it‚Äôs sometimes weird because JS is asynchronous unlike other backend languages. it runs just a bit differently on the browser than in node. ok cool. i need to learn javascript. for the flixbot but also in general to know a new language. if you have any suggested projects to build / resources i'd def appreciate :D. there‚Äôs this awesome website for learning JS. I think a lot of the courses are free. awesome thx man. hmmm but a lot of them are a bit advanced. i'm downloading one beginner course. noice. maybe simething like this. the cool part is that they teach everything in detail. ok awesome. yeah i think the best way for me to level up next is learn a new language. yeah totally and JS is everywhere. this one looks excellent, building an API is the first thing ppl do. . awesome man
